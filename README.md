# MyAnimeList

Create your own recorded list of favourite anime!

Steps:

1. Enter the anime title to retrieve information from the Anilist API.

2. Optionally, you can enter your own personal score rating for each anime and record which year you watched it. The list can then be sorted by your rating or year watched.

3. Toggle the details button for more information on that anime.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
